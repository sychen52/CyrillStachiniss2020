And I will use these coordinate system in this notebook.\n",

    "The one used in the video is a bit confusing because, there are two ways of forming the camera coordinate system in the video. One is at 6:20 and the image plane is behind the camera origin. The other one is at 23:19 and the z-axis is pointing away from the outside world. P.S. any of these two is good if you work out the math properly."
